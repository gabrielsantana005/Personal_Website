                <strong>This very website you're viewing:</strong> As you can infer, this is my first ever website I've
                built directly from scratch. <br>
                I hope to showcase my journey through the tech industry by changing and
                evolving this site as my knowledge grows. <br>

                <strong>A beginner quiz application using Java:</strong> During the Fall 2024 semester at Miami Dade College, <br>
                I took/am taking a Java programming class. Having already taken several other programming classes in the past, <br>
                I understand the importance of working on your own small projects as a way of studying. You can also view this <br>
                project's repository

				<strong>Various miscellaneous projects:</strong> As an aspiring IT professional, I understand that the world of tech <br>
				is unimaginably vast. From programming to web development, network engineer, to information security consultant, <br>
				intern to billionare CEO. While there may be no one out there that is 100% knowledgeable in their respective field <br>
				everyone should have a baseline set of knowledge and skills to build on. That is why I've worked hard to become familiar <br>
				with computer hardware and software troubleshooting and process documentation, simulated network integration using Cisco's <br>
				Packet Tracer, and beginner level programming and front-end web development.
